# Analysis of Aircraft Incident Frequencies by Make and Model: Identifying Low-Risk Aircraft for Commercial and Private Operations
## Business problem
Our company is poised to enter the aviation industry by purchasing and managing aircraft for both private and commercial usage, with the goal of expanding its portfolio. Given the inherent dangers associated with aviation, it is imperative to comprehend these risks in order to make well-informed judgments. In order to ensure a safe and successful launch into the market, this project aims to deliver a data-driven examination of aviation safety with a particular focus on finding the lowest-risk aircraft.
### Data understanding
The data used in this project is a dataset from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.
### Findings
From the analysis conducted on the aviation data, the observations were made:

   1. Cessna and Piper aircraft makes are associated with the highest injury and icident rates
   2. Boeing aircraft have higher survivability rates and are not listed among the top 10 high-risk aircraft makes. 
   3.  The trend analysis shows a gradual decline in airplane incidents over the years, reflecting improvements in aviation technology, safety protocols, and regulatory oversight.
   4. Most injuries occur during Cruise and Take-Off phases, indicating critical points where enhanced safety measures are necessary. 
   5. Personal and Instructional Flight categories have the highest total injuries, indicating they are the most risky.
### Recommendations
1. **Focus on Low-Risk Models**

For starting the new business endeavor, focusing on acquiring and operating low-risk models is advisable. These models have demonstrated better safety records, lower incidents of severe injuries and high survivability rates. A great example is Boeing. Aircraft makes to steer clear of include Cessna and Piper since these are associated with the highest incidents and injuries.

2. **Risk Management for Private Flights**

Since part of the new endeavor is to purpase and operate aircrafts for private purposes, it is of importance that extra attention be given to risk management strategies when operating private flights, seeing as personal flights are the most risky. 
This may include investing in advanced safety equipment, rigorous training programs, and strict safety protocols.

3. **Enhanced Safety Protocols**

It will be essential to instill a strong safety culture in the company. This covers routine incident investigations, safety audits, and incident reviews.
